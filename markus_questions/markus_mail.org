Dear Markus,

Thank you for your questions. I must say that I find some of the questions difficult to answer but I will try to share with you my stake on them.

Unfortunately, my supervisor is currently on holidays until the end of the month and as I have some pressure at contractual level to submit my Thesis before my end of employment at IBM I cannot exchange with him and integrate his opinion in my answer.

Nonetheless, I am sure that you can discuss later directly with my supervisor if it is interesting to you, as he is a very open and helpful person so I am sure he will be happy to share his idea and opinions on it.

Note that as my research that far was mainly theoretical and due to the fact that I had limited exposure to practical applications, I cannot consider myself an expert of practical implementations of Bayesian Networks. My answer will have natural limitations.

I hope that this helps further, let me know if you have more questions.

I will submit then my Thesis tomorrow or Monday next week.

I recall that you told me that it is not necessary anymore to print it? Can you confirm that?

In this sense I guess I should still follow the following directives just sending the digital copies right?

+ Supervisor: One printed + one digital copy (email) of the thesis

+ SfS secretary (HG G 10.3): One printed + one digital copy + zip file with supplementary materials (see details below) + txt file including title, abstract, your name, name of the supervisor (email: sekretariat@stat.math.ethz.ch)

+ Study secretary (HG G 33.1): One digital copy (email: studiensekretariat@math.ethz.ch)

Thank you again for your help.

Best,
Marco
