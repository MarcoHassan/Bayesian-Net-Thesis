   So here it is different. Instead of considering all of the possible
   data completion possibilities, you just choose the one with the
   highest likelihood and go on with this completion and compute the
   parameters according to this. 

   So this is fundamentally different as in the /soft assignment/,
   i.e. the classical EM algorithm what you actually do is to compute
   the parameters considering all of the possible completions and
   compute the parameters based on some average of these.
