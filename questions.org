* Questions to be clarified during the call

** TODO questions Radu

*** TODO check with Radu, if that would actually be true - you would already be over.

    - show him your tablet results.
    
    - just have to implement it in code but it should not be that
      difficult.

    - consider in this sense to extend the thesis to deal with jeffer's
      method and probabilistic evidence. i.e. that would be a natural
      second step for the algorithm.


    


*** TODO Just clarify order of training data entries

    do not really get it... how do you read then out training data?

    training data are given with =.dat= file format.

    So i think that the entries there represents the variables in
    order as usual.

    =x_0, x_1, ....=

    and this respect the same order as the one given in the =.uai=
    file as notation.
